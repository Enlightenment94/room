# Room
Room is a websocket application that prioritizes privacy. We have developed a unique feature called "Hide Room" on each server, ensuring that communication remains end-to-end encrypted. Our concept revolves around the idea of impermanence, where each Room is created with a temporary lifespan. This approach represents a significant improvement over the conventional notion of "Total burn," ensuring enhanced security and privacy for our users.

## Libs:
Ratchet     - Websockets
JSencrypt   - RSA client to client 
Forge       - RSA php to client server login (session)
Php openssl - RSA server

### Future:
1. Linux client.
2. Android client.
3. IOS client.
4. Yourself lib RSA - JS.
5. Yourself lib Websockets.

#### Tasks:
1. Test Ratchet.
2. Test Conn clients.
3. Test encrypt js, php libs.
4. Complete client-js to Ratchet php.
